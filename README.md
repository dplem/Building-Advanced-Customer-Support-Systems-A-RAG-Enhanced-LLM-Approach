# Building-Advanced-Customer-Support-Systems-A-RAG-Enhanced-LLM-Approach

This project demonstrates how to build an advanced customer service chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Unlike traditional rule-based chatbots, this solution provides more flexible and contextually aware customer support by combining:

- Fine-tuned LLMs trained on specialized customer service data
- RAG techniques for dynamic information retrieval
- LangChain for document processing and embedding generation

The system is trained on the Bitext customer-support dataset (26,872 Q&A pairs) and is designed for:

- Customer service teams looking to upgrade from traditional chatbots
- Organizations wanting to improve their automated customer support
- Developers interested in implementing modern LLM-based chatbot solutions

Key Features

- Dynamic response generation using RAG
- Domain-specific knowledge integration
- Contextually aware responses
- Built using the LangChain ecosystem
- Fine-tuned on comprehensive customer service data

This solution helps organizations provide more effective, consistent, and intelligent automated customer support while reducing customer churn and improving satisfaction.
